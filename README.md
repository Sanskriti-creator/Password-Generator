# Password-Generator
Generates password for anything. Includes uppercase, lowercase, numeric values and punctuation symbols.
This is a simple, desktop-based password generation tool built using Python and the Tkinter library. It allows users to quickly generate strong, customizable passwords based on desired length and character repetition rules.
Customizable Length: Define exactly how long your password needs to be.

Repetition Control: Choose between passwords with unique characters (no repetition) or passwords where characters can be repeated for maximum randomness.
Broad Character Set: Uses letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and symbols to ensure high entropy.

Once the application is running, follow these steps:

1.Enter Length: Input the desired number of characters for the password in the "Enter length of password" field.
Select Repetition:
Enter 1 for No Repetition (each character will be unique).
Enter 2 for Yes (characters may be repeated).
Generate: Click the Generate Password button.
View Output: The newly generated password will appear in the read-only box at the bottom.
